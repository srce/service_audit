# Software Engineering Maturity Assessment

## Overview

This assessment was created to help engineering teams reach higher levels of excellence and maturity in their projects.
It does not assign scores or formal ratings. Instead, it highlights weak or risky areas that deserve attention, providing engineers with clarity on where improvement may be beneficial.

The goal is not to force changes, but to support teams in making informed, thoughtful decisions.
